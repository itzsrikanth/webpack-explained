Explaination on Webpack concepts and source code

Notes on webpack inspired from [Sean Larkin repo](http://github.com/thelarkinn/artsy-webpack-tour). Apart from bundling dependencies, Webpack seems to bundle many mysteries within it. Trying to reverse engineer and understand it in crude way by VS Code debugging. I wish I could finish this missing manual to Webpack for Contributors and enthusiasts during this lifttime.
