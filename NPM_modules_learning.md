# List of Useful modules used in Webpack

I was not aware of existence of many modules used here. Used to write my own implementation without tests. Many packages here gave a new direction for me to think out of box, new unexplored territory. NodeJs is like my mother tongue in programming, but after reading one well implemented and maintained open source project, it seems alien to me.

## import-local
As mention in documentation, this package here checks for user's local installation of `webpack-cli` over globally installed on. If local installation is not found, as a fallback, global is used

## v8-compile-cache
Yet to understand its usage, but documentation advises reduced latency in build time

## yargs
Command line parser for interactive CLI with webpack

## interpret (gulpjs)
Here, it is used to get list of all extensions as array

## findup-sync (gulpjs)
